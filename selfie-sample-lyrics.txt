These are the original  lyrics typed into Dre’s phone (on-the-go typos and all)

V1:
 
From the white my shirt to the black of my skin
To the grass in the back, that’s where it begins.
Take it, show ‘em your colors,
Some black and white but mine like no other,
I’m calculated the velocity of thunder,
Cold with with code like code in a tundra,
 
Explore with us come on and we can see will see
What what finna see? (huh)
Tell me now
Visualize yourself and you can be
Anybody now anyone you wanna be
 
anyone can see what it means to believe
if you dont in yaself then its hard to succeed
people bleed people sweat just to say they achieved
all their dreams but it start at the step of vizualizing
and i dont mean like graphs even though the data is there
people sell themselves short like summers here
better learn how to function or else lifell seem unfair
if you analyze closely youll start to see under the layers
 
drop off the roof now,
see (c) yaself up never lose now
pluses come in like a huge crowd
positive thoughts all you use now
wait
simulate a bike you can move round
aye
 V2:
 
now tell me what we really on,
i’m tryna get into a zone
just like a wolf im by my lonesome
don’t be surprised you find me gone
down to the bone im a champ
and i stamp that
better know yo goals and where you at what’s the next step
yo i can tell that you been stressed so address that
like a mets cap snap back to peace of mind
like gray matter, fasten up we on a ride
tired i’m red (imread) all up in my eyes
cuz i been up since a quarter past 5
but that’s okay tho i lay low
work hard so i can play go
the whole mile half way don’t
count,
like an infant, but this is
a different image you get it
at first the color was vivid
turn black and white and then you click it
that made some sounds that we went with
it got me grinning
winters coming game of thrones how it’s all about layers
but it’s way deeper than just clothes you can’t find it at savers
watch how tables start flipping like gymnastics
the fact is it’s like magic what’s happening
at the snap of my finger
been on the phone with life this whole time yet feel like i ain’t meet her
cuz it’s always more to know like we tryna code
no fr tho better check stack overflow
but for life tho
but for life
but for life tho
but for life
